## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of two fundamental recommender system approaches:

1. **Rule-Based Recommender System**: Uses explicit business rules to generate recommendations
2. **Content-Based Filtering System**: Uses item features and similarity metrics to recommend similar content

Both systems work with the Netflix titles dataset and provide different perspectives on content recommendation, showcasing the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## 🔧 Systems Implemented

### 1. Rule-Based Recommender System

**Approach**: Uses predefined business rules to filter and recommend content.

**Key Features**:

- **Rule 1**: Recent movies with specific ratings (PG-13/TV-MA)
- **Rule 2**: International TV shows sorted by release year
- Transparent and interpretable recommendations
- Fast execution with minimal computational overhead
- Easy to modify business logic

**Strengths**:

- Complete transparency in recommendation logic
- Consistent and predictable results
- No cold start problems
- Easy to implement and maintain

**Limitations**:

- No personalization capabilities
- Static rules that don't adapt to user preferences
- Limited scalability for complex recommendation scenarios

### 2. Content-Based Filtering System

**Approach**: Uses item features and similarity metrics to recommend similar content.

**Key Features**:

- TF-IDF vectorization of textual features
- Cosine similarity computation
- Interactive user input for dynamic recommendations
- Combines multiple content features (description, genre, cast, director)
- Real-time similarity-based recommendations

**Strengths**:

- Personalized recommendations based on content similarity
- No dependency on user behavior data
- Works well for new items with sufficient metadata
- Transparent similarity scoring

**Limitations**:

- Limited to content features only
- May suffer from over-specialization
- Requires rich item metadata
- Computational overhead for similarity calculations
